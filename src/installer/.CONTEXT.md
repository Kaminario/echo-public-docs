## Installation Workflow

1. **Pre-flight Checks**
   - `EnsureRequirements`: PowerShell version, admin privileges
   - `ReadConfigFile`: Configuration validation
   - `SkipCertificateCheck`: SSL certificate bypass setup
   - `ensureOutputDirectory`: Output directory and write permissions validation

2. **State Tracking Setup**
   - `LoadCompletedHosts`: Load simple completed hosts list from processing.json
   - `IsHostCompleted`: Filter out already completed hosts to avoid duplicates
   - **Automatic Resume**: Skip successfully completed hosts from previous runs

3. **Installer Preparation**
   - `EnsureLocalInstallers`: Download/locate installer files
   - Caches files in `$SilkEchoInstallerCacheDir`

4. **Connectivity Validation**
   - `EnsureHostsConnectivity`: Tests all hosts sequentially
   - **✅ FAULT-TOLERANT**: Failed hosts logged, script continues with valid hosts
   - **ISSUE**: Should be parallel per todo requirements
   - **FAILURE POINT**: Hosts marked with `host_connectivity_issue`

5. **Authentication Setup**
   - `UpdateHostSqlConnectionString`: SQL connection strings
   - `UpdateFlexAuthToken`: Flex API authentication
   - `UpdateSDPCredentials`: SDP credential validation

6. **File Distribution**
   - `UploadInstallersToHosts`: Parallel upload in batches
   - **✅ FAULT-TOLERANT**: Failed uploads logged, script continues with successful hosts
   - **FAILURE POINT**: Hosts without `remote_installer_paths` property are excluded

7. **Installation Execution**
   - `MainOrchestrator`: Fixed batch processing (MaxConcurrency)
   - `InstallSingleHost`: Starts PowerShell jobs
   - `ProcessSingleJobResult`: Waits for completion, processes results
   - `MarkHostCompleted`: Marks successful hosts in completed list immediately
   - **ISSUE**: Waits for entire batch before starting next
   - **ISSUE**: No timeout control (can hang indefinitely)
   - **ISSUE**: No progress indication

8. **Result Collection**
   - Results collected only after batch completion
   - Saved to `installation_logs_<timestamp>.json`
   - `SaveCompletedHosts`: Completed hosts persisted after each successful job
   - **ISSUE**: No immediate log collection

## Current Limitations

### **Timeout Issues**
- No explicit timeouts on installation jobs
- `Wait-Job` calls are indefinite
- Jobs can hang without recovery mechanism

### **Batch Processing Issues**
- Fixed batch sizes with blocking behavior
- Cannot start new jobs until entire batch completes
- Inefficient resource utilization

### **Error Handling Issues**
- Connectivity failures stop entire execution
- Upload failures prevent all installations
- No graceful degradation for partial failures

### **Progress and Monitoring Issues**
- No real-time progress indication
- Appears frozen during job execution
- No intermediate status updates

### **Persistence Issues**
- No tracking of completed installations
- Cannot resume interrupted executions
- Duplicate installations possible

## Faulty Host Marking System

### **Host Fault Detection Points**

#### **1. Configuration Validation (orc_config.ps1:ReadConfigFile)**
- **Location**: Configuration file parsing
- **Failure Mechanism**: Script exits entirely on invalid JSON or missing required fields
- **Current Behavior**: Complete termination (no continuation)
- **Marking**: N/A - script terminates

#### **2. Connectivity Validation (orc_host_communication.ps1:EnsureHostsConnectivity)**
- **Location**: Host connectivity pre-checks
- **Property**: `issues` array (✅ **UPDATED**)
- **Failure Scenarios**:
  - Invalid `host_auth` value: `"Invalid host_auth value. Must be 'active_directory' or 'credentials'"`
  - AD auth with non-domain user: `"Current user is not logged in to Active Directory"`
  - IP resolution failure for AD: `"Could not resolve IP X.X.X.X to hostname for active_directory auth"`
  - Connectivity test failure: `"Failed to connect to host using [auth_type] authentication"`
  - Invalid IP for credentials: `"Invalid host address 'X'. Must be an IP address for credentials authentication."`
- **Current Behavior**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Mark failed hosts but continue with valid ones
- **Implementation**: Uses unified `issues` array instead of separate field

#### **3. Upload Failures (orc_uploader.ps1:UploadInstallersToHosts)**
- **Location**: File upload to remote hosts
- **Property**: `issues` array + `remote_installer_paths` (✅ **UPDATED**)
- **Current Behavior**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Mark failed uploads but continue with successful ones
- **Implementation**: Upload failures added to unified `issues` array, missing `remote_installer_paths` indicates failure

#### **4. Installation Job Failures (orc_invoke_remote_install.ps1:FetchJobResult)**
- **Location**: Remote installation job execution
- **Property**: `JobState` = 'Failed' vs 'Success'
- **Failure Scenarios**:
  - PowerShell job state != 'Completed'
  - Job execution errors
  - Script execution failures
  - Timeout conditions (not currently implemented)
- **Current Behavior**: Individual job failures logged, counted in summary
- **Marking**: Already implemented correctly

### **Current vs Required Behavior**

| **Stage** | **Current Behavior** | **Required Behavior** |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Configuration** | Script terminates on errors | Should validate and report only |
| **Connectivity** | Script terminates if any host fails | Mark failed hosts, continue with valid ones |
| **Upload** | Script terminates if any upload fails | Mark failed hosts, continue with successful ones |
| **Installation** | Individual failures logged ✓ | Already correct |

### **Host State Properties**

Hosts carry state information through these properties:
- `issues`: Array of strings tracking all problems (connectivity, upload, etc.) - empty = valid
- `remote_installer_paths`: Present = upload successful, missing = upload failed
- Final result `JobState`: 'Success' or 'Failed' after installation

### **Current Critical Issues**

1. **EnsureHostsConnectivity** (line 191-202 in orchestrator.ps1):
   ```powershell
   if ($failedHosts.Count -eq 0) {
       ImportantMessage "Hosts connectivity check succeeded."
   } else {
       # Exits entirely instead of continuing with valid hosts
       return
   }
   ```

2. **UploadInstallersToHosts** (line 227-232 in orchestrator.ps1):
   ```powershell
   $uploadSuccess = UploadInstallersToHosts ...
   if (-not $uploadSuccess) {
       # Exits entirely instead of continuing with successful hosts
       return
   }
   ```

## WORK PLAN - TODO ITEMS

  - ✅ **Further optimized**: Replaced `GetProcessingStatePath()` function with `$SilkEchoProcessingStateFile` constant
- **Testing**: Verify state persistence across script runs

### **Phase 2: Fault Tolerance (Priority: HIGH)**

#### **TODO-3: Modify validation logic to mark invalid hosts but continue execution**
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Files**: `orchestrator.ps1` (lines 232-252, connectivity validation)
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Changed from script termination to graceful continuation with valid hosts
  - ✅ Filter out failed hosts and continue with remaining valid ones
  - ✅ Log warnings instead of errors for failed hosts
  - ✅ Update host count messaging to show failed vs continuing hosts
  - ✅ Only terminate if NO valid hosts remain
- **Testing**: Verify continuation with mixed host validation results

#### **TODO-4: Update file upload logic to mark failed hosts as invalid but continue**
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Files**: `orc_uploader.ps1` (UploadInstallersToHosts function), `orchestrator.ps1` (upload handling)
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Removed immediate termination on individual upload failures
  - ✅ Continue processing all uploads even when some fail
  - ✅ Mark hosts without `remote_installer_paths` as failed uploads
  - ✅ Return success if ANY uploads succeed (not requiring ALL)
  - ✅ Filter out failed upload hosts and continue with successful ones
  - ✅ Added clear messaging about upload failures vs successful uploads
- **Testing**: Verify partial upload scenarios

### **Phase 3: Timeout and Performance (Priority: HIGH)**

#### **TODO-5: Add timeout protection for remote installer processes**
