# Developing rules

## Commit Guidelines

- Keep commit messages short and concise
- Each line should be no more than 80 characters
- No references to AI/Claude or co-authors
- Focus on what changed and why, not who made the changes
- Before adding files to a staging area produce commit message and confirm with me.
- Never attempt to add files to a staging area. It should be a direct directive form the user.
- Never change files without my approval.
- when I ask a question, answer to the question and do not fix or change code.

## Resolve issues

- when you experience a conflict and it is not clear what to do, describe the issue to me, analyze and provide possible solutions, and ask me what to do
- do not change APIs without my confirmation

## python rules

- avoid imports in functions
- avoid complex functions, split them into smaller ones
- avoid deep nesting
